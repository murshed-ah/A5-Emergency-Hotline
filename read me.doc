1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?
ans: getElementById: grabs 1 element by its ID from html.
     getElementsByClassName: grabs many elements with the same class 
     querySelector: grabs the first match (CSS-style selector).
     querySelectorAll: grabs all matches (CSS-style selector list).


2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
ans: Use document.createElement("tag").
Add text/attributes if needed.
Use appendChild or append to place it inside another element.

3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
ans: When clicked an element, the event first runs on the element, then bubbles up to its parent, then higher parents.

4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
ans: Puts one listenr on a parent instead of many children.
     It’s useful because it’s cleaner, faster, and work for new elements add later.

5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
 ans: preventDefault() → stop the browser default behavior (like stopping a link from opening).
      stopPropagation() → stop the event from bubbling up to parent.
